                <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>2/3 cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>2/3 cup Marsala wine</li>
                <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 tsp fresh thyme</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the chicken in the pan 
                and cook until golden and barely cooked through.</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the pan and melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in the pan.
                Add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to brown.</li>
                <li>Add the shallots, garlic, and salt and cook for one more minute. Add the broth, Marsala,
                heavy cream, thyme, salt, and pepper. </li>
                <li>Scrape any brown bits from the pan to incorporate in the sauce. Bring the liquid to a boil,
                then reduce the heat to medium and gently boil, uncovered, until the sauce is slightly 
                thickened and darker in color.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken back to the pan. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the chicken is 
                warmed through.</li>
                <li>Serve!</li>
            </ol>
