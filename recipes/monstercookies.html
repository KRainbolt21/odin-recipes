            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These cookies are my husband's absolute favorite, and for good reason! They're packed with
            pretty much everything you could want in a cookie, including M&M's, chocolate chips, oats, 
            and peanut butter. They're good anytime, but they're the best when they're straight out of the oven!</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
